The LasaurShield is a custom PCB for the [Lasersaur project](http://lasersaur.com). It's an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) [shield](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoShields) that helps in wiring up the Lasersaur. Most of the components on the shield are connectors. See the [BOM](http://labs.nortd.com/lasersaur/manual/bom) for ordering the components.

The LasaurShield is designed around the SparkFun Eagle Library, their design and CAM job rules. Check out the [SparkFun Tutorial](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/108) if you are new to this.


The following Eagle library and design files are being used:

- cam/sparkfun-gerb274x.cam
- dru/SparkFun.dru
- lbr/[SparkFun.lbr]
- lbr/con-phoenix-254.lbr (comes with Eagle)
- lbr/con-phoenix-508.lbr (comes with Eagle)
- lbr/con-weidmueller-sl35.lbr (comes with Eagle)
